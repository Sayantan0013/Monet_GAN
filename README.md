# Moret_GAN  
## Basic Idea
* A **Generator** that takes input as photos and tries to generate photos of painting style similar to monet 
* A **Discriminator** that takes two input one Monet painting and another real or fake monet painting here fake will be generated by the Generator and tries to guess If the given painting is real or not
* As of now both the input painting for the Discriminator would be randomly chosen
* Along with the loss coming from discriminator the Generator is also fed with a L1-Loss so the output image of the generator is close to the Input image
